title: ['Allow for floating windows ¡¤ Issue #10121 ¡¤ microsoft/vscode ¡¤ GitHub']
Hi,
I suggest floating windows option for:

Terminal
Debug console
Problems
Output

Eventually:

tabs
Explorer / search / debug / git / extensions

This way we could take advantage of large screen space and / or multi monitors.
Having to constantly switch between the various windows is not optimum working flow.

title: ['Allow to change the font size and font of the workbench ¡¤ Issue #519 ¡¤ microsoft/vscode ¡¤ GitHub']
At the moment, we can only change the font size / font of the editor. If we want to change the font size, we need to use a roundabout method of "zooming in / out". It would be nice if this could be adjusted through the preferences.

VSCode Version: starting at 1.13.0, up to current
OS Version: Fedora 24-27

Looks like VS Code is listening to mouse scroll events, even while it is not active in the window.
Related:
https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=608246
https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=807187
Steps to Reproduce
requirements: Browser (Chromium / Firefox / Google Chrome), VSCode Editor (Any file type. Ideally a long file to ensure the scroll is visible.)
VSCode: Leave cursor at top of file.
Browser: Scroll, excessively, (For a few seconds) down the page. Even if it's a blank tab with no content.
VSCode: Scroll, ever so slightly, in any direction.
You'll find the editor will jump suddenly further down the active file.
It seems VSCode is receiving the scroll events, for whatever reason; which are all suddenly evaluated upon any form of scroll input in the editor.
Updates based on comments
GUESS: Appears to be an issue with Electron and some input libraries?
Is not isolated to VScode
Fix: Does not yet exist.
Linux Workarounds (Not to be confused with a fix)
imwheel - not suitable for all users
wayland - not suitable for all users
Note: Ubuntu 19.04 (Desktop) appears to be using Wayland.
I'm not sure we will see further updates in here, which is a bit disappointing from the developers, given the amount of comments from affected people. I would like to have some official guidance, even if it's pointing us to other resources.

Whole my life I used ide where there was a customizable toolbar. I starded to use vscode and stopped to use it after one day. It is impossible to remember all shorcuts. In any other popular ide you can put any menu item on toolbar and use it from time to time.

WTF MS? VS code? VS users?
Don't tag it "out-of-scope" as you did before with similar requests. Even simple editors have toolbar.
It isn't advanced feature it's basic feature for most people.
Using ide without toolbar is not user friendly for most users. It is vim way.
People really need it like "exit from vim":






FAQ FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE AGAINST THE TOOLBAR:

I don't want to use toolbar so I am against that feature-request.

It is not a problem "it is optional toolbar". If you don't want you can don't use it.

If you want it so why don't you form a team and submit a PR?

People have offered, go look at the many other bug reports made on the same issue. MS has said they would likely reject it. They don't even want to add hooks to make a plugin possible. So it's not a resource issue, it's an ideological one.

Temporary workaround by @GorvGoyl:

It seems like it won't be the high priority feature in foreseeable future so I made this extension which adds handy buttons like beautify, list files, undo, redo, save all etc to the editor menu bar in the VSCode. Shortcut Menu Bar

title: ['Allow to open multiple workspaces in the same window ¡¤ Issue #43188 ¡¤ microsoft/vscode ¡¤ GitHub']
Workspace feature is great because we can grouping projects in a top context (microservices projects in a big API workspace). But, only one workspace can be open. This feature can be powerful if multiple workspaces can be open at the same time (in the same window).

And another request : it will be great if :

Right click on the workspace name should open menu with a "settings" item (which open xxxx.code-workspace).
Workspace settings should contain a name attribute (to clearly identify the workspace in the left pane in VS Code)

title: ['Improved column selection (Alt+select) ¡¤ Issue #5402 ¡¤ microsoft/vscode ¡¤ GitHub']
The column selection implemented in #1515 is a start, but it's a bit awkward and unintuitive compared to other editors.
With the following editors or IDEs, you can create a column selection starting from where the mouse is clicked/dragged:

Atom (with Sublime Style Column Selection)
Eclipse
Notepad++
Programmer's Notepad
Sublime
Visual Studio 2015

At least Eclipse, Programmer's Notepad, and VS2015 support virtual whitespace as well, creating a complete square/rectangle.
Some of them also don't show multiple cursors, which I think looks better.
Other users were also expecting this behaviour (see here and here).

The outline view lives inside the file explorer and while it can be re-arranges in there it cannot be dragged into its own view. Alternative locations could be:

Config is stored in ~/.config/Code[ - <quality>]/User. To match platform conventions (lowercase and hyphens for everything) as well as to keep consistency with the cli code[-<quality>] I propose we change the settings directory one of:

~/.config/code[-<quality>]/user
~/.vscode[-<quality>] (see #3883)
~/.code[-<quality>] (to prevent using 'vs' showing up in the OSS build as it is now)

If we moved this it would probably require some discovery/migration on first launch of a newer version.

The below is a living document.
Proposed folder structure
Notes:

I don't think we should be encouraging the use of admin rights within vscode, instead a permissions elevation dialog would probably be better than allowing a specific place for root user data #5561
I want to clean up the whole code vs vscode thing in this change; only official builds should carry the visual studio branding, that should carry over to the config directories consistently as well.
The CLI args --user-data-dir and --extensions-dir will need to be adjusted for this, something like --config-dir and --cache-dir would probably be better.

title: ['Allow tabs to wrap to multi-line ¡¤ Issue #70413 ¡¤ microsoft/vscode ¡¤ GitHub']
I almost always have more tabs open than fit in the horizontal space provided. I have seen the thread on shrinking tabs to try to fit them in one line #15048, and I've also seen this closed feature request for what I'm asking for - #32836. That issue was closed saying there would be no changes for 6-12 months, and it has been around 15 months now so wanted to reopen discussion.
JetBrains IDEs added this a few years ago - simple config option to wrap open tabs to multiple lines rather than extending indefinitely horizontally, forcing a horizontal scroll or use of the Open Editors section in the left bar. While the Open Editors block is a nice idea, I've spent so many years switching via tabs (and continue to do so in all my other editors) that I'm requesting a better solution.

title: ['Support to open a project folder in multiple VS Code windows ¡¤ Issue #2686 ¡¤ microsoft/vscode ¡¤ GitHub']
Currently VS Code prevents opening a folder more than once which makes it impossible to work on a project in multiple windows (e.g. on multiple displays).
@bpasero @dbaeumer @egamma @alexandrudima please raise any obstacles and issues you might foresee with this request.
Issues found so far:

 we use the workspace path as identifier to communicate back from debug target to debug host
 we need to verify cross platform that there is no code causing issues when running over the same root folder (e.g. file watchers)


Please note: Initially I've created this feature request for a specific use case: enable debugging of multiple processes.
In the meantime, debugging of multiple processes has become possible without the need for opening a folder more than once (see #13426). But instead of closing this item (as no longer necessary), I've repurposed it by removing the specific debug use case.
For transparency you can find the original comment below:

Currently it is not possible to debug more than one process from a single VS Code project (= window)
because VS Code prevents opening a folder more than once.
The workaround is to open VS code on a subfolder within the original folder, which means to restructure the project (which is not desirable).
This feature request asks for lifting the constraint and allowing to open a project folder multiple times.

title: ['Support variables when resolving values in settings ¡¤ Issue #2809 ¡¤ microsoft/vscode ¡¤ GitHub']
Hi,
I was just reading the latest updates and it says one can install typescript@next globally and then set typescript.tsdk so VS Code can use the appropriate version/installation. In a team environment, I'd like to put that setting in our project, something like:
.vscode/settings.json:
{
    "typescript.tsdk": "%APPDATA%/npm/node_modules/typescript/lib"
}
The problem is restarting VS Code results in an error:
The path c:\Projects\Derp\%APPDATA%\npm\node_modules\typescript\lib doesn't point to a valid tsserver install. TypeScript language features will be disabled.

Now the setting needs to be per-person because I highly doubt my teammates have tsc installed in C:\Users\Olson\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules\typescript\lib ðŸ˜‰
Could we get environment variables evaluated on that and all other settings that involve paths?
I haven't tested other paths, but I see these in the Default Settings:

git.path
markdown.styles
json.schemas
typescript.tsdk
php.validate.executablePath

title: ['Exclude all files except for... ¡¤ Issue #869 ¡¤ microsoft/vscode ¡¤ GitHub']
The files exclude allows you to set true/false values, but it doesn't seem to take them completely into account.
For example, I would like to hide everything except for the scripts folder. You might then assume that this would do this:
{
    "files.exclude":
    {
        "**/*": true,
        "**/Scripts": false
    }
}

It does not do that, it just hides everything. In order to achieve this, you must list every file and directory except for the Scripts directory, and who knows how many directories there are and if a new directory/file gets added you then must edit the list to exclude those.
In the end, their should be a way to hide everything except for xxx.

title: ['Mac: Provide a setting to hide the title bar and inline the window controls ¡¤ Issue #12377 ¡¤ microsoft/vscode ¡¤ GitHub']
Hello there, a lot of the standard apps in recent versions of macOS have started to inline their titlebar into their tabs, menu buttons etc. I assume this is mainly to save vertical space on laptops. However, like all UI trends, apps that don't quite keep up end up feeling old-fashioned ðŸ‘¯
I started a fork of VS Code that uses the inline style:

There needed to be a few changes:

I moved the sidebar width to 76, to fit the traffic lights
I increased the height of the elements that act as the titlebar by one pixel, mainly so that they align with the centre position of the titlebar items
Allow mouse dragging via the sidebar, and the title elements

Fork: https://github.com/orta/vscode/tree/inline-titlebar
Changes: orta/vscode@master...mac-titlebar-inline
I realise that VS Code is a cross-platform project, and so these changes should probably only be applied in the context of macOS, which I'm happy to look into with some advice (I don't have a windows/linux machine to hand for example).
I also know that no-one wants big unexpected UI changes on their OSS projects, so I've not made it as a PR, but I'd love to know if/what I can do to move this upstream?
Sidenote: If someone can tell me how, I'm happy to make a downloadable build for people to try too, I couldn't find a way to do it - I'm still quite fresh to npm projects.

I am using VS Code on a project at work that has hundreds of files and many layers of nested sub-directories. I frequently make changes that break many files, such as changing the call signature of a commonly used method. Since the project is entirely typescript, it is useful to be able to open the "Problems" view and see the errors and warnings my change caused in the files I have open. However, because of the size of the project, I still need to go to my terminal and run our own make commands to see the list of problems. I then need to perform the fun dance between my terminal and VS Code, searching for the right line in the right file before I can fix the problem.
What I need is a way to tell the "Problems"  view to show me all errors and warnings across all open and closed files in my project. This would allow me to see all problems in a single list and quickly click through and fix them.

We are using chokidar for file watching. Chokidar is known for performing bad over large folders (see paulmillr/chokidar#410). To investigate:

can we consume a newer version of chokidar with the scalability issue fixed
can we change our watching strategy to only watch what we need instead of always watching root
can we switch to another watching library that is more efficient

Workaround:
Find the large folders in your workspace and add them under the files.watcherExclude setting

title: ['[windows] Slow opening (vscode, file, folder...) ¡¤ Issue #56644 ¡¤ microsoft/vscode ¡¤ GitHub']
Issue Type: Performance Issue
Hi,
Since the last july update and the switch to the user version (vs. all users version) of vscode, everything is slow. Vscode takes like 20 seconds to open and then when I click on a file it takes another 10 seconds to open it.
I tried to disable all extensions, nothing changed.
The problem came right after I downloaded the "user version" of vscode. Before that, I had the "all users version" installed and everything was ok. Maybe it's because I'm on an entreprise computer linked to a windows domain and our user PATH is special and located on a network drive.
Thanks in advance for your help !

35.  https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/1751
title: ['Universal Language Injections ¡¤ Issue #1751 ¡¤ microsoft/vscode ¡¤ GitHub']
Language injections is a feature of IDEs like Webstorm and PHPStorm that auto-detects when a language is use inside another language and then shows syntax highlighting for that injected language. VS Code currently supports this in a few places:

<style> tags in HTML get CSS highlighting and IntelliSense
<script> tags in HTML get JS highlighting and IntelliSense
HTML in a PHP file outside of <?php ?> gets highlighting but no IntelliSense

But there are many other contexts where this would be helpful, that are currently not supported and impossible to all hardcode:

style attribute in HTML contain CSS
String literals in languages like PHP often contain SQL, see #1361. PHPStorm supports this for PHP, but Webstorm for example does not support this for NodeJS. It should really be supported in any language.
String literals commonly contain HTML in Javascript or PHP (e.g. with jQuery, Angular or Vue templates)
String literals commonly contain GraphQL queries in JavaScript
HTML event attributes contain Javascript, like onclick="event.preventDefault()"
Countless HTML attributes in the Angular framework have Javascript-like expressions in them, like ng-if="ctrl.items.length > 0 && someOtherValue", but also the mustache syntax {{ ... }}.
<script type="text/ng-template"> contain Angular templates which is nothing but HTML. This pattern of templates in script tags exists in many of the major client side MVC frameworks.
Javascript has RegExp literals. In other languages like PHP, RegExps are passed as strings. This is also the case in tasks.json problem matchers for VS Code (RegExp inside JSON string)

All of these examples currently don't get colored and receive no autocompletion. It would be awesome if VS Code was able to automatically detect languages in any context (like string literals, HTML attributes and tags) by some language patterns, like < > tags for HTML/XML, keywords like SELECT, INSERT, etc. for SQL or template string tags like gql for GraphQL. This could be contributed by extensions or language servers.
This would be one of the best features VS Code could offer.

Explain:
There are certain extensions that play well together, and it would be useful to be able to set a config file to enable and disable certain extensions in that workspace.

I would like to be able to configure settings that are specific to my user and to a particular workspace. So, 'local' workspace settings?
So there would be three locations for settings (for a single-folder workspace):

user settings
${workspaceRoot}/.vscode/settings.json
${workspaceRoot}/.vscode/settings.local.json

This way, I can add .vscode/settings.json to git, and share project settings such as "exclude node_modules" but I can gitignore .vscode/settings.local.json and add things specific to that project that I don't want to share, such as git autofetch.
I originally thought to suggest .vscode/settings.user.json, similar to how VS Pro handles similar configuration, but that might be confusing.

Apologies if this has come up before; I'm unable to find any related issues.
It would be cool to be able to publish extensions in a beta form (similar to Code Insiders) so that they can be run "in production" with real users that have opted-in. This would reduce the disk in publishing an extension because you can push it to a smaller number of users for testing (I probably don't need to sell this to you, I guess you have Insiders for very similar reasons).
I know we can package and distribute extensions ourselves for now, but it's not as easy (eg. updating is not automatic).
I originally thought the "Preview" flag might've provided this functionality but unless I've overlooked something, it does not seem to.

Refs: #48421
Setup:

clone https://github.com/bpasero/remote-fs
F5
click "Refresh" in the explorer
you should see the current working directory as a remote folder using the file system provider for scheme datei://

I can think of 2 reasons why a permission error raises:

user needs elevated rights to change a file or folder
a file can be readonly (e.g. Windows) and to save it you need to first remove the readonly flag

Currently there does not seem to be a way to signal a) to save as elevated user or b) to remove the readonly flag.
I am not sure how relevant this is for any other file system provider that does not have these concepts but this is something our file service can do (via the options overwriteReadonly and writeElevated).

title: ['Extract the integrated terminal ¡¤ Issue #34442 ¡¤ microsoft/vscode ¡¤ GitHub']
"Feature" request.
The integrated terminal grows in functionality, to the point that it could soon become very useful standalone, as its own app. I'm only a casual VScode user (using vim most of the time), but I would definitely be interested in a well-behaved, consistent, reactively-configurable, multi-platform terminal not tied to the editor.
Obviously if such a situation were to unfold, the shared component (not entirely dissimilar to VTE) should be jointly developed and shared with VScode. Both could be able to leverage a common configuration so that whether a terminal leveraging such a theoretical common component is spawned within VScode or standalone, they behave the same.

title: ['Allow hiding the buttons in the tab bar line and in the panel title bar ¡¤ Issue #46403 ¡¤ microsoft/vscode ¡¤ GitHub']
A small change related to the buttons in the tab bar line:

Open Changes
Split Editor
Close

and to the buttons in the panel title bar:

New Terminal
Split Terminal
Kill Terminal
Maximize Panel Size
Move to Bottom
Close Panel

For users who have already memorized the keyboard shortcuts for these commands (and considering the existence of Ctrl-p and Ctrl-Shift-p), the buttons are kind of redundant. It would be nice to have an option to hide them as almost everything in the UI already can be hidden. I know about Zen mode, but Zen mode also centers the text in the editor, hides the panel/terminals, makes Visual Studio Code full screen and all sort of other things which might not be desirable.
As a note related to this, Vim and Emacs users generally tend to hide the UI. Funnily enough, even the beast that is IntelliJ IDEA allows it ðŸ˜†

VSCode Version: 1.0.0

Steps to Reproduce:
I'm trying to bind quick open (ctrl+p) command to shift shift (shift x2) keys like IntelliJ IDEA in VS Code Extension (TypeScript).
But vscode.commands.registerCommand('type', (args) => args.text) can't detect shfit key.
How can I detect shift shift key?

title: ['Feature Request : SHOW / HIDE comments in editor ¡¤ Issue #46505 ¡¤ microsoft/vscode ¡¤ GitHub']
Hi VsCode teams !
Why developers need it

Adding comments and documentation in a codebase is very important for maintenance.
But often it could make it harder to read (especially if you use jsdoc or swagger)

Conclusion: toggling comments visibility could be a very nice productivity feature directly inside VSCode ! Moreover, this feature exists on most of other text editors.
Question
If i missed the feature in VSCode, how could i show / hide comments in my code ?
I saw this extension on vscode store, but it's not maintained and it doesn't work with last versions of VSCode
Thanks for your work ! ðŸ‘

title: ['1.36 scrolling suddenly laggy - precision touchpads ¡¤ Issue #76594 ¡¤ microsoft/vscode ¡¤ GitHub']
Since updating to 1.36 the scrolling experience got bad.
I increased the multiplier to have the same speed, but it still feels "heavy" to scroll, not the same as before - what change could be the cause for this?
Same in the explorer view (with or without the new guides).
Here it looks like the renderer skips frames, jumpy and not calm (also the scroll multiplier does not seem to have an effect here, merely Alt).
I'm using a precision touchpad device (Dell) but this is not the old problem and cannot be solved by resizing the window.
It is especially annoying in the explorer tree, bordering close to the unusable level.
After trying for a while I will now downgrade to 1.35.x. This seamingly little handicap somehow greatly impacts productivity, at least for me, feels like having a slow computer.
Update: Yes, 1.35.1 is definitely faster and lighter to scroll (did you add some animation? my setting for 'smooth scrolling' is deactivated). I will have to stay on this version until this is fixed.
Cannot find anything in the release notes except "This is a major Electron release and comes with Chrome 69 and Node.js 10.11.0 (a major leap forward from our current version with Chrome 66 and Node.js 10.2.0)". I guess it won't be easy to locate the issue. However, the new version is not usable, for me (Windows 10, precision touchpad).

VSCode Version: 1.11.0
OS Version: Ubuntu 16.04

I have my Caps Lock key bound to Escape using setxkbmap on Linux. This worked fine till 1.10, but broke with 1.11. At first I thought it was an issue with the VSCodeVim extension, but the issue persists with all the other Vim extensions on the marketplace as well. Pressing the escape button still works as expected.
The binding is still respected everywhere else in the operating system, it's only Visual Studio Code that ignores it for some reason.
Steps to Reproduce:

Run setxkbmap -option caps:escape (binds caps to escape for the duration of the session)
Hitting caps lock when in insert mode (with a Vim extension like VSCodeVim installed) no longer puts you normal mode.
Hitting escape still works as expected and puts you in normal mode.

Issue Type: Performance Issue
It is not slow to start-up, it is slow to do anything in the text editor (scroll, find, type, etc). For example, when scrolling, the screen is unable to keep up with the mouse wheel and it will keep scrolling for a while after I stop the mouse wheel. I disabled the extensions I installed lately, and also reduced the amount of files in the workspace.

Following discussions from #15524, #29169, #66343 and #50448.
Currently we see problems from different sources (linters, tasks, etc) and they sometimes stay there after the problem or the source file is gone, e.g. problems in an unsaved buffer, in files that were renamed, or files removed when we switch Git branches.
More often than not I have a bunch of problems and the only way to clear that pane is to restart the entire editor.

Initial problem is that npm install takes twice as long to install dependencies when vscode is running. I've figured out that this is because of file watching for node_modules folder so I added it to files.watcherExclude. I uses following combinations (but non of them seems to be working):

        "**/node_modules/**": true,

Add an element to the List selection such that you have two items selected - Screen reader does not announce that an item is added to the selection

I have checked what native Windows Explorer does with NVDA - nothing.
And what Finder does with VoiceOver on mac - and they announce when the element after the first is added to the selection.
It announces NAME added to selection 2 items selected
I think we should strive for this experience if possible, so nothing announced if only one item is selected but announce when other items enter the selection

It would be nice to have a watcher task as preLaunchTask in launch.json. At the moment this is not possible because the launch task will not start before the preLaunchTask ends.
A long running preLaunchTask should have a regex similar to problemMatcher to wait for a specific text in the output window before executing the launch task.
In my scenario I'm running webpack dev server as a watcher task. I want this task to run if F5 is hit and the preLaunchTask is not running. To delay the debugger launch it would be useful to test for a specific string in the output window webpack: bundle is now VALID.

Today we restart the extension host whenever the first folder changes because workspace.rootPath is always set to that first folder and it never used to change after the extension host started once.
If we would not restart the extension host anymore an extension:

could use workspace.rootPath as before, it would still point to the first folder always (which can be undefined if the workspace contains no folders)
could subscribe to the onDidChangeWorkspaceFolders event to get notified about updates
would see the value of workspace.rootPath changing during runtime whenever the first folder changes

I have been seeing hangs happen on and off since 1.33 was in insiders, but never pinpointed anything. And while I still haven't pinpointed anything the frequency has increased (even at the very end of 1.33). I have noticed that the hangs very often coincide with kicking off a task (usually it is a compound task).
How best can I help capture information to get to the bottom of it? When it happens the window is hung completely so I can't open devtools or anything like that.

title: ["[theming] Access theme's colors programmatically  ¡¤ Issue #32813 ¡¤ microsoft/vscode ¡¤ GitHub"]
I think we should add support for accessing theme's colors programmatically.
For instance let's take as an example the popular OneDark Pro theme, I'd like to access colors defined under tokenColors.
My use case: I'm making an extension that decorates some tokens, and I'd like them to have the same color that comments have in my theme, the problem is that the regex I use to find those tokens depends on some configurable value, so I cannot pre-compute it in advance and just put it in a .tmLanguage file.
It's already possible to somehow access colors defined under the colors key, via something like new vscode.ThemeColor ( 'activityBar.background' ), adding support for this sounds like a useful generalization to me.
What do you think?

title: ['Allow to configure editor auto reload behaviour ¡¤ Issue #23107 ¡¤ microsoft/vscode ¡¤ GitHub']
VSCode Version: 1.10.2
OS Version: macOS 10.12.3
Steps to Reproduce:

Open editor
Modify a file in your git repository, but don't save it
Checkout a different branch that touches the same file
Go back to the editor and try to save
ERROR: "Failed to save 'file1': The content on disk is newer. Click on Compare to compare your version with the one on disk."

Personally I would like to see the files being reload from the disk every time. With git I don't have to worry about losing history. Similar to how SublimeText works. If the files change in disk (ex, change of branches), they should automatically get reloaded, independently of their current state in the editor. I prefer this behaviour, rather than having to confirm reloads from popups.
With that said however, there should be options for other use cases.
Add an editor.autoReload parameter in order to control this behaviour. Possible values:

Always - reload from disk
Confirm - show a popup/toast notification
Never - current behaviour?

Took the idea from @rmunn on #23043 issue. Decided it was best to create a separate issue for this.

title: ['Shortcut for opening color picker and insert color of selected format ¡¤ Issue #52364 ¡¤ microsoft/vscode ¡¤ GitHub']
Problem
A huge dealbreaker for me is that VSCode just doesn't let me use the color picker ever, because I'm using Sass files. There does not seem to be any color picker extension that provides the functionality either, that isn't Windows-specific (I'm running macOS).
Feature request
I'd like the ability to spawn a color picker anywhere. So there would be a command that does exactly that, and when you're done it inserts the color code.
A nice inclusion would be if it could know if the cursor is in a color code, and accordingly update that color code. VSCode seems to do this only in a few file types now, which is a bummer for anyone not using those. I don't demand this, as long as I can get a color picker I'm content.

title: ['Add some API to support GUI customization ¡¤ Issue #1833 ¡¤ microsoft/vscode ¡¤ GitHub']
VS Code is a great coding IDE, but developers love to customize their tools to make them feel like home and VS Code lacks those customization abilities.
I love the sublime material theme and I wanted to implement it in VS Code but as far as I can see it's not possible now because only the coding area is customizable. So in my opinion some improvement in ui customization would be welcomed by a lot of us. In the ideal word every pixel and element of VS Code should be customizable with extensions, but for start it would be enough to start with the following things:

customization of the side panel (#427 and #123)
adding support for custom tabs, the possibilities of the quick box is very limited (#710)
adding the ability to add and remove ui elements (e.g. a bottom panel for error listing like in Atom)

I have read about the approach followed by VS Code. So instead of allowing extensions to create custom ui elements, VS Code itself should provide some API for this, what allows to the developers to set the content, but the styling of the content should be based on the theme of VS Code.
So in a nutshell: VS Code core provide the bones and template of the ui elements, extension developers can set the content but not the style and theme developers can style the content.

title: ['Offer code mark styles and gutter marks ¡¤ Issue #9209 ¡¤ microsoft/vscode ¡¤ GitHub']
From @darkred on July 10, 2016 23:30
(Using VSCode 1.3.0 in win 10 x64 build 10586 with vscode-eslint extension 1.10.18).
Currently the code marks(for errors and warnings) appear only as squiggly underline (i.e. as spellchecker errors in browsers, e.g. Firefox, Chrome):
(the error is in red, and the warning is in green)

My suggestion is to offer more code mark styles (ideally  the outline style, as it highlights the errors/warnings the best way -see below- ) and gutter marks :
(with the errors to be in red, and the warnings to be in yellow, as ESLint itself uses these colors - not green)

(here is another screenshot)
It's more easy to distinguish the errors this way.
Thank you

For reference SublimeLinter3 package offers five different code mark styles :

fill,
outline   (the default style),
solid underline,
squiggly underline, and
stippled underline

and two types of gutter marks:

errors, and
warnings

Workaround (from @bpasero)
You can use this extension: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rssowl.copy-relative-path-posix
Original Issue:

Looked for other mentions but haven't found related requests or discussion.

I'm often using Copy Relative Path feature to compose import strings or share with other developers on Mac/Linux. Therefore, new Copy relative path feature that has native path separators on Windows doesn't help in these cases (in comparison with Copy path).
Please add option to change path separators used in Copy Relative Path action, so I will be able to set / as path separator and have same behavior across all platforms.

title: ['Environment variables defined in `tasks.json::tasks.options.env` do not overwrite existing environment variables ¡¤ Issue #47985 ¡¤ microsoft/vscode ¡¤ GitHub']
Code: 1.22.2
macOS: 10.13.3
When I create a task, I want to provide a very specific environment (which is why I bother filling out the JSON values). However, if an environment variable is pre-existing, it will not be overwritten in the execution environment of the task.
I am extremely surprised by this behavior. I discovered this by not being able to find a library I was building with a task when specifying DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH.
A very simple test is to update ~/.bash_profile to include
export FOO=bar

Then attempt to override it with tasks.json
{
    // See https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=733558
    // for the documentation about the tasks.json format
    "version": "2.0.0",
    "tasks": [
        {
            "label": "diagnostic",
            "type": "shell",
            "options": {
                "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}/beam",
                "env": {
                    "FOO": "baz",
                }
            },
            "command": "printenv",
            "problemMatcher": []
        }
    ]
}

Output:
...
FOO=bar
...

A "task" appears to execute . ~/.bash_profile to set it's environment. Since it is already creating a new environment for each execution, it would be nice if I could override the values as I see fit, by specifying the values in tasks.options.env.

CC @isidorn
System Info

Version: 1.46.0-insider (system setup)
Commit: cd41dd1

Electron: 7.3.0
Chrome: 78.0.3904.130
Node.js: 12.8.1
V8: 7.8.279.23-electron.0
OS: Windows_NT x64 10.0.18363

Steps to Reproduce:

With either NVDA or JAWS loaded, type any commands in terminal (Ctrl+`) input area.
Press Shift+Tab two times from the terminal input to focus in terminal output list view.
The terminal output list is reachable via tab key thanks to tabindex = "0" attribute; however, screen readers (both NVDA and JAWS) do not read anything with arrow keys unless users manually switch on browse mode.
The additional problem can be found with very long terminal outputs that require scroll behavior. Screen reader users have to switch back to forms mode to arrow up/down  to scroll through the output history (while not being read any current line) and again, turn back to browse mode to check the results.


Does this issue occur when all extensions are disabled?: Yes

Suggested Solutions
Currently, the terminal output <div> container denoted with class = "xterm-accessibility-tree" has role = "list".
As a blind developer myself, I am requesting the following for accessibility improvements for screen readers.

Please change the value of role attribute from "list" to "document" so that screen reader users can navigate the terminal output via arrow keys using browse mode.
Please adjust the tabindex value of this terminal output container in the way that screen reader users can quickly Shift+Tab from terminal input area. In other words, pressing tab key from terminal output area should go to terminal input area; pressing Shift+Tab key from terminal input goes to terminal output area denoted with role = "document" div.
Ideally, it would be great if the terminal output can be also included in the F6-keycycle.

title: ['Provide Task Runner viewlet ¡¤ Issue #28235 ¡¤ microsoft/vscode ¡¤ GitHub']
We did a Task 2.0 deep dive today and this issue collects the combined feedback received.
Task Properties

echo should be true by default so that users get a better idea of the task executed
we should support flattening the JSON properties as we do with other settings (e.g "terminal.echo": true instead of "terminal": { "echo": true }
we should better separate task declaration from task customization. Currently both happens in the tasks array property and the differentiating element is the customize property.

Task Picker
The task picker should support a decription / detail message to better explain what the task does. We also discussed whether the task picker should support MRU which would automatically move the most used tasks up to the top without customization. If we provide a task panel (see below) such a MRU list could be useful there as well.
Task Customization
The task customization is currently instance based where the task instance is identified by a task id, which can be quite 'cryptic'. An alternative way would be to identify a task based on a type and a key that is defined by the type and therefore can vary from task runner to task runner. So instead of having something like:
	{
		"customize": "vscode.npm.run build",	
		"taskName": "npm: run build"
	}
a customization would look like this
	{
		"customize": {
			"type": "npm",
			"file": "${workspaceRoot}/package.json",
			"script": "build"
		},
		"problemMatcher": ["$tsc"]
	}
where the structure of the identifying attribute is defined by the extension providing the runner support. In the example above the fact that a npm script is identified by the location of the package.json file and the script name comes from the npm extension. This might look different for task contributed by gulp of TypeScript
Problem Matchers
For task that execute a target of a task runner (e.g. gulp, npm, grunt) VS Code can't decide which problem matchers to attach. Since picking the right problem matcher currently requires editing the tasks.json file we should better support the user with this. We discussed the following ideas:

always attach all known problem matchers if a task has no problem matchers. This might result in false positives and might require us to support removing problem matchers via a configuration mechanism.
we could help the user attaching a problem matcher by generically scanning the output for problems and suggest problem matchers that exactly match these. If selected we update the tasks.json file for the user.

Task panel
It was suggested to run tasks in its own panel instead of reusing the terminal panel. They should still be executed using the terminal to get ANSI control character support and other nice terminal features (e.g. Ctrl+C). The panel could offer additional features like:

a task summary (execution time, exit code, ...)
the output of a task could be folded (like travis does for example)
allow for in place customization of a task (for example attach a problem matcher) without the user being forced to edit a tasks.json file.

We also discussed the need of a task viewlet but decided that this will not add any big additional value over the task picker and a separate panel.
Top Level Menu
We were also discussing whether the tasks deserve a top level menu. In general this was consider a good idea. However such a menu should be semantically not technical. So instead of naming it Tools or Tasks it would be better to offer top level menus like Build, Rebuild All, Clean, Run Tests. The downside of such an approach is that such a menu looks out of place if none of these entries trigger any meaningful action in the workspace (e.g. if a simple JS project is open at lease Build, Rebuild All and Clean don't make any sense)
Better Selfhosting
Would be great if we can improve the self hosting coverage of tasks. This is currently hard to do due to the fact how we build. But @dbaeumer will tweak our tasks.json to support more tasks currently run in the terminal (e.g run tests, linting, ...)

title: ["Marketplace: searching by an extension's name is practically broken ¡¤ Issue #42890 ¡¤ microsoft/vscode ¡¤ GitHub"]
There are a few major problems when searching by an extension's name. First of all, if I remember correctly, the marketplace had this thing on every extension's page:

So I've added an analogous message to all of my extensions' readme files, and I think other extension authors have done this too.
I have an extension called Todo+ (full id: fabiospampinato.vscode-todo-plus). This is what happens when the command ext install vscode-todo-plus is executed:


vscode-todo-plus in an exact match of the id minus my username, and the extension is not even in the top 10 results.
Searching for fabiospampinato.vscode-todo-plus, which is an exact match of the full id, leads to the same results.
Searching for @id:fabiospampinato.vscode-todo-plus works, but only inside VSC, it doesn't work on marketplace.visualstudio.com
Where are these ext install and @id: commands documented anyway?

Let's try to search for another extension of mine, Open in Browsers (full id: fabiospampinato.vscode-open-in-browsers):


Not only vscode-open-in-browsers is an exact match of the extention id minus my username, but "Open in Browsers" is the extension's title, and "vscode" is practically a meaningless keyword, as is "in". What's the first result for this search? vscode-ins-support ??

I hope we do agree there's a problem here.
If I may suggest a few improvements:

Always check if an extension's id (minus the username) is an exact match of the current query.
Implement stop words.

Please don't close this issue as "non actionable".

Proxy support for Visual Studio Code has been introduced recently through environment variables/settings (see https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview#_proxy-server-support). As an extension developer I would like to use these settings when requesting resources from the internet. My current implementation fails for users using a proxy.
What is the recommended way for an extension to use a proxy?
I could not find a vscode API that exposes methods to make requests using a proxy other than access to the proxy settings (workspace.getConfiguration()) and implementing everything on my own. Looking at the Visual Studio Code code base I identified the code that adds support for proxies, but copy&paste it into my extension would result in duplicated and potentially outdated code, which is something I want to avoid whenever possible. As I am probably not the only extension developer accessing the internet, I would like to hear your opinion on this issue. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.

Why?
Think of it as software running on the web.   When I go to cnn.com, I'm not notified that there's a new version of the back-end software that I might be running.   So why / when should I care if the front-end software has updated?
Sometimes you care -- such as low-bandwidth situations.   But that doesn't mean everyone cares.   Some of us, dare I say, a large majority of people, just want the latest stuff all the time.

Similar to behavior in Visual Studio, is there a way we could get the terminal to show/hide automatically? Leaving some sort of tab at the bottom of the screen?
It opens when:

User mouses over the tab
Something is written to the terminal

It hides when:

User clicks outside of the open terminal window.
The terminal has not been written to within a set period of ~10 seconds.

Ex: I'm working on an Angular 2 application using the angular-cli build tool. When I'm writing code or clicking through the UI I don't particularly care about what's displaying in the terminal. But as soon as I save my changes and the build process starts, I DO want to quickly see what the current state of the build is. So after saving a file, when the CLI tool starts writing to the terminal, it would pop-up from the bottom, and as long as my mouse isn't hovering over it, it will hide again after several seconds of inactivity.

The behavior I see is that it randomly happens. My best guess is that the previous attached debugger hasn't finished closing down when the new one tries to start up on the same port. This is due to the "restart": true. I don't know how this process works but from what I read it keeps track of the node process, but does it keep track of the previous debugger?

title: ['MSIX installer ¡¤ Issue #61793 ¡¤ microsoft/vscode ¡¤ GitHub']
After 2 years of conversation in issue #10759 (Release in the Windows Store) I think this is the right time to reevaluate the request.
What we originally wanted is all the goodness of UWP lifecycle management (clean install/uninstall and updates received in the background without having to run the app), but now it's possible outside of the Store with MSIX packaging without having to comply with some of the stricter rules of the Store and resource/capability management of UWP apps.
So the proposal is simple: Please make an MSIX installer for VS Code even if it's not distributed through the Store (for numerous technical reasons).
As a first step, Windows 10 users would benefit from it, later, as MSIX is designed to be cross-platform, it can evolve into the only installer format on all platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows 7+) and as the Store evolves, it can be a good foundation to potentially publish VS Code to the Store.

Hello,
Since Finder is obviously developed by Apple, I'm not sure if this would be possible or not. Is there any way to right-click a folder in Finder, and "open with VS Code?" You can do this with individual files, but it would be a nice, small workflow enhancement to be able to open a folder with VS Code, directly from Finder, as well. If not, no big deal. This would be a fault with Finder, rather than VS Code.
Here's a screenshot of right-clicking a folder ... there's no "Open With" option. Maybe the Share option could work somehow?

Issue Type: Bug
problem:
VirtualBoxVM crashes with Application Error while running VSCode

start with Windows 10
Run Oracle VirtualBox
create linux mint VM
run linux mint VM
install VSCode for Linux from tar.gz
clone some repo from GitHub
cd into local repo and start editor (usually code -a .)
work with VSCode in local clone (unsure exactly what activity triggers this)

After some unpredictable amount of time, clicking on a menu or the settings icon (maybe some other actions also trigger), the expected pop-up menu will be all black instead of filled with content.  A short time (usually no more than a minute) later, the guest VM will be unresponsive and an Application Error dialog will appear in the Win10 host.  The VM is dead at this point.  Here is the content of the dialog just received:
The instruction at 0x00007FF84210F161 referenced memory at

Click on OK to terminate the program

This has been a consistent problem in the VSCode versions since I started.  May be tied to git plugin and editing in a directory that is a git repo.

OS: Windows_NT x64 10.0.19041
OS Version: Windows 10 Pro

Steps to Reproduce:

Open a project VSCode native to windows
use the terminal
Open another (or the same) project in WSL 2 (using the WSL2 extension not just typing wsl in the terminal)
use the terminal again..
If you have Windows Terminal installed, compare the performance between that and the integrated terminal (with a project in WSL 2)


Does this issue occur when all extensions are disabled?: Yes
The integrated terminal seems to be a bit slow when using WSL2.
I have zsh installed but i don't think its that because Windows Terminal is snappy and works fine in the same directories, the issue is only in the integrated terminal.
It isn't super slow, but it does have a laggy feel.
The issue doesn't appear to be with WSL as other terminals outside of VSCode are fine.

title: ['Word navigation not working with screen reader ¡¤ Issue #90578 ¡¤ microsoft/vscode ¡¤ GitHub']
From @RobGallo
Depending on which edit control is being used, the problem is either in UIAutomations¡¯s Text pattern implementation or IAccessible2¡¯s IAccessibleText implementation. Either way, the text returned for the word at the carat position is incorrect.
Here are the basic rules:
The text of words returned by the accessibility API must match keyboard word navigation (ctrl+leftArrow and ctrl+rightArrow) exactly.
The behavior of ctrl+leftArrow and ctrl+rightArrow must be symmetrical (i.e., the word breaks must not change regardless which command is used).
The placement of the carat should never be on white space, except at the end of a line
Word navigation should stop at all punctuation marks
Here is a line from a file I¡¯m working in. I started at the beginning of the line and I placed vertical bars (|) where the ctrl+rightArrow stops.
import| {| NamedSFC| }| from| '../../|common|/react|/named|-sfc|';|
based on this, the words returned by the accessibility API should be:
¡°import¡±
¡° {¡±
¡° NamedSFC¡±
¡° }¡±
¡° from¡±
¡° '../../¡±
¡°common¡±
¡°/react¡±
¡°/named¡±
¡°-sfc¡±
¡°';¡±
If this doesn¡¯t look right to you, good. The places where the keyboard stops, and thus what is considered a word, make no sense. And as a coder myself, I find these word breaks not useful because I am often placed on space characters. That would be a problem even if I weren¡¯t using an access technology.
I would arrange the words in the line this way:
¡°import ¡°
¡°{ ¡°
¡°NamedSFC ¡°
¡°} ¡°
¡°from ¡°
¡°'¡±
¡°..¡±
¡°/¡±
¡°..¡±
¡°/¡±
¡°common¡±
¡°/¡±
¡°react¡±
¡°/¡±
¡°named¡±
¡°-¡°
¡°sfc¡±
¡°'¡±
¡°;¡±
Visual studio breaks up the line this way, which is also acceptable:
¡°import ¡°
{ ¡°
NamedSFC ¡°
¡°} ¡°
¡°from ¡°
¡°'../../¡±
¡°common¡±
¡°/¡±
¡°react¡±
¡°/¡±
¡°named¡±
¡°-¡°
¡°sfc¡±
¡°¡¯;¡±
Furthermore, the behavior of ctrl+leftArrow and ctrl+rightArrow in VSCode is not symmetrical. For example, here are the word breaks starting from the left and moving right:
from| ¡®../../|common
Here are the line breaks for the fragment starting at the end and moving to the left.
from |¡®../../|common
Notice the positioning of the line break between ¡°from¡± and ¡°¡¯¡± has changed. That is disorienting.

title: ['[theming] Separate workbench theme and syntax theme ¡¤ Issue #25986 ¡¤ microsoft/vscode ¡¤ GitHub']
After upgrading to VS Code 1.12, I noticed that the workbench theme of the built-in Monokai color theme had been changed. However, I preferred the default workbench theme a lot.
But in VS Code, there are only two types of themes: Color Theme and Icon Theme, and the workbench theme is tightly coupled with the syntax theme in the Color Theme category.
In contrast, Sublime Text separates theme into color_scheme and theme in the preferences. For example, I can choose Material style for the workbench and Monokai for the syntax highlighting. Does the team have plan to separate them and let users have more flexibility to customize their editor?
By the way, I found that some of theme extensions use .json as their theme file (including the built-in Monokai), but the official documentation only mentions that we can use yo code to generate theme extension with an existing .tmTheme file. Is there any documentation for clarifying their difference and also the schema of the .json file?

title: ['Extensions using the "type" command (for ex. Vim) have poor performance due to being single-threaded with other extensions ¡¤ Issue #75627 ¡¤ microsoft/vscode ¡¤ GitHub']
I don't know if this is a known/accepted issue, but I've had a number of users complain of poor performance in the editor when using my extension along with the Vim extension.
This appears to be because the Vim extension uses the type command to handle keypresses (in the extension host). This means if pressing a key triggers a command that blocks in another extension (for example the first character press can trigger code completion, which if the list is 20,000 items can block the thread for a little while while they're build + serialised) the typing in the editor is really sluggish.
You can easily reproduce this by making an extension that blocks for 1s when asked for completions:
context.subscriptions.push(vscode.languages.registerCompletionItemProvider({ scheme: "file" }, {
	provideCompletionItems(document: vscode.TextDocument, position: vscode.Position, token: vscode.CancellationToken, context: vscode.CompletionContext): vscode.ProviderResult<vscode.CompletionItem[] | vscode.CompletionList> {
		console.log('Completion request');
		var start = Date.now();
		let i = 0;
		while (Date.now() < start + 10000) {
			// Block for a second...
			i++;
		}
		return [new vscode.CompletionItem(`aaaItem (${i} iterations)`)];
	},
}));
If you run this and enabled the Vim plugin, when you start typing on a newline (which triggers completion), the characters you type won't appear for a while.
Of course, extensions should try to avoid blocking the extension host as much as possible, but sometimes it's unavoidable (for ex. assembling and serialising a huge number of completion items). It's not clear where users should raise bugs, since in isolation neither extension is really doing anything wrong.
I don't know what the fix is (separate extension host for type-handling extensions might work, but that might also be a huge task), but I couldn't find any issues discussing this and figured it was worth some discussion (even if only to have the information described in one place we can point people to that hit these issue).

This is incredibly annoying. I can't think of a time when you would want to multiselect case-insensitively with ctrl+d. It simply selects the wrong stuff, because in code it's always case sensitive. So depending on whatever I did last with ctrl+f, my ctrl+d either works or is annoying.
I think ctrl+d should always be case sensitive, or have a button that's not search-tied that does a case sensitive string selection match across the file
My two cents.

I would like to eliminate the step of pressing ctrl+k v to preview the md file I open. For the preview should always be on.
Thank you

title: ['Sluggish User Interface on High-Resolution Screens ¡¤ Issue #75111 ¡¤ microsoft/vscode ¡¤ GitHub']
Issue Type: Performance Issue
Hey there, I often experience sluggish and laggy UI when working with VS Code, e.g. clicking on tabs, activity bar icons, menus, etc.
Is this related to certain machines or is it a global problem? And are there currently any workarounds? Isn't VS Code supposed to be smooth and fast by nature?
Thanks in advance.

title: ['Allow to specify the tsconfig.json filename explicitly  ¡¤ Issue #12463 ¡¤ microsoft/vscode ¡¤ GitHub']
currently VSCode uses the file with the exact name tsconfig.json in the folder as the project file for a typescript project,
i have a few other project files named differently for corresponding sub-projects inside the same folder, I wish there was a way to tell VSCode to use one of them rather then the default tsconfig.json

title: ['Debug Console should support find ¡¤ Issue #4338 ¡¤ microsoft/vscode ¡¤ GitHub']
VSCode Version: 0.10.10
OS Version: Ubuntu 14.04

This goes along with a few other debug console feature requests that I see (ex: #3974), but it would also be nice if find worked in the debug console.
Steps to reproduce:

Start debugging something, have the console be full of text
Hit Ctrl-F to find

Result: Find works in the editor window instead of the debug console

VSCode Version: 1.3.0
OS Version: Windows 10 64bit & Mac OS X 10.11.3

Steps to Reproduce:

Open the Quick Open box
Type a file name that returns several results
A new Preview editor pops up and receives focus with the first result loaded into it
Scroll through the results in the Quick Open box and the Preview editor changes to the file that's highlighted
Selecting a result will fully open the file. Canceling can close the Preview editor or leave it open. I'd prefer if it closed the preview.

Keyboard shortcuts are central part of VS Code, there are a lot of them and I think I use only a fraction of them. It would be awesome if VS Code could suggest what shortcut should I learn, based on how I use the app with mouse. For example if  I click between editors a lot, then VS Code could somehow tell me to use ctrl+1 and ctrl+2. This way I could gradually learn shortcuts that would increase my productivity the most.

Steps to Reproduce:

Open a javascript project with a node_modules folder (couple packages installed)

It will show results from the node_modules directory even if you have added the following your user/workspace settings:

Each Client item belongs to a different namespace. If the completion item detail was shown immediately for each item then users could, at a glance, easily identify the relevant item out of a list of similarly labeled items. I suppose the argument against is that this can be done by modifying the label to include this, but then what is the role of the detail property?

I tried it several times, but even if I didn't hang up, mac stopped and started moving for about 1 minute. In this case,> is input as many characters as validation->>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>.
When pasting validation-> string with copy and paste
Mac hangs up.

title: ['Incorrect indentation for single line if/for/while/etc, multiline chaining statements etc ¡¤ Issue #43244 ¡¤ microsoft/vscode ¡¤ GitHub']
I am experiencing some weird indentation issues. Not using any plugins to prettify or similar.
if (condition) {
    return; // <-- correct indentation
}

if(condition)
return; // <-- incorrect indentation

Some ppl claim this should be avoided. I don't agree. Using pair of { } for simple early exits messes up code. Putting the return on the end of the same line can be hard to read if the condition is long.
This is not exclusive to return. Applies to all single lines.
same problems apply to for, while, etc.
var transformedValues =
originalValues <-- incorrect should be indented one level.
.where(condition) <-- incorrect, should be indented two levels.
.select(transform); <-- incorrect, should be indented two levels. 

function someFunction() {
    callToSomeOtherFunction(
         variableWithLongNameWhichRequiresASeparateLine,
         anotherVariableWithLongNameWhichRequiresASeparateLine);
    }  <-- incorrect should not be indented.

title: ['?? Notebook API announcements ¡¤ Issue #93265 ¡¤ microsoft/vscode ¡¤ GitHub']
We introduced a proposed API for Notebook but currently the API is majorly two managed object: NotebookDocument and NotebookCell. We create them for extensions and listen to their properties changes. However this doesn't follow the principal of TextEditor/Document where TextDocument is always readonly and TextEditor is the API for applying changes to the document.
If we try to follow TextEditor/Document, the API can be shaped as below
export interface NotebookEditor {
    readonly document: NotebookDocument;
    viewColumn?: ViewColumn;
    /**
     * Fired when the output hosting webview posts a message.
     */
    readonly onDidReceiveMessage: Event<any>;
    /**
     * Post a message to the output hosting webview.
     *
     * Messages are only delivered if the editor is live.
     *
     * @param message Body of the message. This must be a string or other json serilizable object.
     */
    postMessage(message: any): Thenable<boolean>;

    /**

Currently there are only two fields in the TextEditorOptions API, a few other TextEditor-related APIs, and none of them is able to deal with the text buffer's encoding.
Comparing to Atom's TextEdit API, that is far from enough.
Most importantly, the API limitation makes it (seems) impossible for vscode-editorconfig to implement features like charset support, which is a crucial need for many people.

title: ['[html] prevent that embedded grammars can corrupt syntax highlighting of rest of document ¡¤ Issue #20488 ¡¤ microsoft/vscode ¡¤ GitHub']
Currently, when writing embedded language, a lot of the times the embedded grammar can cause disruption to the rest of DOCUMENT:
This is html grammar.

Imagine editing css in a <style> at the <head> of a long html file. The rest of document will be constantly re-tokenized and (wrongly) syntax highlighted. This doesn't look good UX-wise and will probably have some perf impact.
For the following grammar and setting:
- name: source.css.embedded.html
   begin: <style>
   end: </style>
   patterns:
   - include: source.css
"embeddedLanguages": {
  "source.css": "css"
}
I hope VSCode can only apply CSS grammar to the section between <style> and </style>, so when I'm typing out my incomplete CSS VSCode would just re-tokenize and highlight until </style>, but not rest of the document.
/cc @alexandrudima
Also would like to hear @aeschli's opinion, as you are writing the html grammar.

title: ['Test Runner Viewlet with an Extension API to plug into [Enhancement Request] ¡¤ Issue #9505 ¡¤ microsoft/vscode ¡¤ GitHub']
In response to Erich Gamma's tweet @Krzysztof-Cieslak
A test runner viewlet/sidebar with a pluggable API would be a great addition to vscode.
The viewlet should include visual indications of

the progress of completed tests out of the set of tests being run
visual indicators or icons showing basic tests states at the least
not run |  success | failure | ignored/skipped


The test runner should be able to provide a set of sorting categories and repopulate the viewlet based on the users selection

A query box with the ability to filter the tests based on the names shown in the runner's list at a minimum, with the ability for the underlying runner to populate a set of query filters.

Instead of the VS style of collapsing categories

I think the vscode style used in the debugger viewlet is much nicer ??

A button could be used to select which test runner you want to use out of the test runner extensions that have been installed

But a dropdown menu would work too

A side button to open a menu could enable the active test runner to populate it with any additional commands specific to its functionality

Some other functionality points -

When an individual test is selected the result could be rendered in the output panel
An icon/button to run all tests
The ability to highlight/select a set of tests and only run those tests
A basic set of run options, which individual runners might be able to extend

Tests outputs can contain links to specific points in source code
Debugging specific tests (would be awesome, but understandable if this is too difficult for an initial implementation)
Associate test runner extensions with specific languages?
Test playlists (would be nice, but not especially important)
Ability to specify a task/trigger that will repopulate the viewlet's list of tests
Dropdown menu that the test runner can population with platform/environment/runtime configurations to use during test execution.

title: ['Add support for additional global config files (in addition to settings.json) ¡¤ Issue #17634 ¡¤ microsoft/vscode ¡¤ GitHub']
It would be very helpful for somebody attempting to sync config files between multiple machines if VSCode supported some system for having multiple config files included at a time.
Benefits:
Imagine a config folder structure like this on a developer's mac:
- settings.json -> ~/Drive/dotfiles/settings.json
- settings.local.json -> ~/Drive/dotfiles/settings.my-mac.json

And then like this on a developer's linux desktop:
- settings.json -> ~/Drive/dotfiles/settings.json
- settings.local.json -> ~/Drive/dotfiles/settings.my-arch.json

Using symlinks, then, a developer would be able to have specialized configuration files for each computer, while keeping the vast majority of options synced between both.
Implementation:
I can think of two simple ways to implement this with as little friction as possible.

An editor.includeConfig option in the main settings.json
This might be a JSON array, with support for various different config files. It could also just be a single field.
Whether or not the option should be recursive is up to the VSCode team.
VSCode searches for all config files in the directory matching settings[.foo].json and includes those.

Conflicts:
If going with option (1) above, conflicting config entries should take precedence the later they appear in the includeConfig array.
If going with option (2), the main settings.json file should take precendence.

I have several shortcuts defined using Ctrl+Alt+.  The ones that have a vowel no longer execute the shortcut, but instead insert an accented character.  This started with the latest update -
Version: 1.31.1 (user setup)
Commit: 1b8e830
Date: 2019-02-12T02:20:54.427Z
Electron: 3.1.2
Chrome: 66.0.3359.181
Node.js: 10.2.0
V8: 6.6.346.32
OS: Windows_NT x64 6.1.7601
The keyboard shortcuts that no longer work
{
"key": "ctrl+alt+e",
"command": "cursorLineEnd",
"when": "editorTextFocus"
},
{
"key": "ctrl+alt+a",
"command": "cursorLineStart",
"when": "editorTextFocus"
},
I've tried this with extensions disabled and in insiders and the result is the same.  When I try to add the shortcut using the "Define Keybinding" button, when I type the 'e', the Ctrl and Alt disappear from the editor and only the 'e' is left.  The language set in the OS has not changed, nor has the keyboard setup - standard UK keyboard.
How do I restore the shortcuts and remove the accented characters?
Thanks

title: ['Support expanding input parameters into multiple arguments ¡¤ Issue #83678 ¡¤ microsoft/vscode ¡¤ GitHub']
Currently, it is possible to specify debug arguments from input, using this syntax:
        "inputs": [
                {
                        "id": "mystr",
                        "type": "promptString",
                        "description": "",
                }
        ]

And having this prompt appear in launch.json:
        "configurations": [
                {
                        "name": "myexe",
                        "type": "cppdbg",
                        "request": "launch",
                        "program": "myexepath",
                        "args": [
                                "${input:mystr}"
                        ]
                }
        ]

This will cause a prompt to appear, asking for arguments to pass to the application. However, it is only possible to pass one argument that way.
It would be nice if it was possible to expand this:
"-a 5 -b 10 -c 15 -d \"some string\""

into this:
["-a", "5", "-b", "10", "-c", "15", "-d", "some string"]

This would make opportunistic debugging (testing with different parameters quickly) much easier, and will avoid polluting the launch.json with targets that are used only once and then discarded.

Terminal shows the output. Now, clear the terminal using command palette     >Terminal: Clear
Terminal gets clear now.  Run the file again in the terminal    >Python: Run file in terminal window
Here is where issue shows up - the terminal still shows all the previous outputs from before the last clear command.  IMO, desired should be that terminal should not show any previously cleared outputs.

Does this issue occur when all extensions are disabled?:
Yes, the issue reoccurs.  (Note: All except the "Python" extension were disabled.  Python extension is needed to run the python file in terminal.
I had also posted in Super User forum thinking this was some issue with my system. And then I tried it on a clean build of VS code and it got repeated.  Hence, I decided to post it as a bug.

title: ['Add ability to extend from other settings files ¡¤ Issue #15909 ¡¤ microsoft/vscode ¡¤ GitHub']
Inspired by TSLint's ability to extend configuration files, it would be nice if .vscode/settings.json could behave the same way.
So if I have some global settings set up:
~/example-repo/.vscode/my-company-settings.json:
{
  "editor.tabSize": 2,
  "editor.insertSpaces": true,
  "editor.formatOnSave": false
}
I can use them in another file, without having to duplicate the settings:
~/example-repo/my-project/.vscode/settings.json:
{
  "extends": "../../.vscode/my-company-settings.json",
  "editor.formatOnSave": true,
  "editor.fontLigatures": true
}
And the computed settings for ~/example-repo/my-project/.vscode/settings.json would be:
{
  "editor.tabSize": 2,
  "editor.insertSpaces": true,
  "editor.formatOnSave": true,
  "editor.fontLigatures": true
}
Scenario:
Multi-root workspace doesn't solve this for our use case. We have a bunch of npm modules each in their own git repository. We have a package which contains our shared tsconfig.json and tslint.json settings that all the other packages include with extends. We don't use a multi-root workspace since the idea is that people can clone the specific package(s) they need to work on. Every repository contains the exact same .vscode directory which is essentially copy&pasted all over the place. Maintaining the .vscode settings for the projects is "not pretty" compared to the tsconfig.json and tslint.json which only require the settings package to be updated with for example yarn upgrade.

Hi, we are experiencing weird behaviour with VSCode and Win10 at the office.
My co-worker and I both have the same machines with Windows 10 1809 installed and noticed that VSCode will eventually soft freeze the whole operating system.
Once the system is frozen (by reproducing using the steps), all windows except for Google chrome and chromium based applications (Google Chrome, Slack, VSCode) are visually responsive, but nothing else happens when interacting with the operating system or UI elements - just as if someone pulled the plug from the SSD/HDD. For example: Launching a shell and trying to ping results in the cmd window freezing.
We will have to hard reboot our machines TWICE - rebooting once does not work, as Windows 10 will stay on the grey loading screen (with the spinner) forever - or even randomly lock out the drive and ask for a bitlocker recovery key (but not after the second (!) reboot).
This issue may be related to #49425 , but should be fixed by now with Windows 10 1809 ?!
WIN+CTRL+SHIFT+B doesn't help here :)

Upon saving a file edited with VS Code, it appears to perform line ending normalisation automatically and without user notification of any sort. Because of this, I've found myself bitten by large diffs in Git (I'm aware you can circumvent this using the -w flag) where a trivial fix to a single line of source code appears to affect a significant proportion of the file, which makes pull requests and reviews for such changes on GitHub a pain to sift through. Then again, I guess one could argue why a source file with mixed line endings should stay in version control like that anyway!
Visual Studio Community displays a prompt upon opening a file if it has mixed line endings and lets a user decide whether or not to have it fixed.

This screen-cap showcases how it works in Emacs with undo-tree.

Zalastax@c569971 contains the changes to the model that are needed, but several questions remain to be answered. I'm interested in completing the feature but need further input before proceeding.

How should the UI look? Graphics / ASCII, clickable?
Should the tree be formatted like in Emacs undo-tree (as short tree as possible) or like Vim's Gundo http://screenr.com/M9l (one state per line sorted by time)?
What unit-tests should be added?

You can try out the current changes by compiling my fork and you'll find 'History Tree' in the Edit menu. Clicking the menu item will console.log a function that changes what redo future is selected (just like in the gif).

Hi there,
In my project, I have files with quite long file names (beyond my control).  This limits me to having 3-4 tabs show in my workbench at once.  I would like to be able to rename these tabs, or control their label format myself, in order to have more condense tab titles and thus more easily navigate my tabs.  This was roughly suggested by #21662 but was not really addressed by #12965 -- any of the options for workbench.editor.labelFormat still give me tab titles that are too long.  Can workbench.editor.labelFormat be modified, for example, to optionally take a formatter lambda function we can provide?  As just one example of a reasonable formatter one might write, it could be that you fix tab titles to 20 chars, and for long filenames you truncate and prepend with "...".  Additionally, one might want to assign nickname/shorthand tab titles for commonly used files.  Please pardon me if there is already a way to do this (would love to know how!), but if not, I'd sincerely appreciate considering this as a feature request.
Thanks!

title: ['In some cases orca reads spaces instead of reading tabs. ¡¤ Issue #104673 ¡¤ microsoft/vscode ¡¤ GitHub']
Issue Type: Bug
This was previously reported on the orca list and appears to be related to the upgrade to electron 9.
Steps:

Launch orca.
turn on Speak indentation and justification in the tab speech of orca's preferences page.
Open an empty file in VSCode.
Press the tab and type this is a test.
Press the enter key.
Browse the text using up and down arrow.

Orca reads the text preceded by the number of leading spaces in the line, as expected.

Convert the indentation to tabs.
Browse the text using up and down arrow.

Orca should read the text preceded by the number of initial tabs in the line but instead it announces that there is a space at the beginning of the line.
On the orca list @joanie commented the following:

This commit fixes the problem -- though it's not a specific fix for
it: https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/e49659287. Not
sure if it should be cherry-picked into Electron 9 or not....

At the moment, if any environment variables change, or new "apps" are installed while VS Code is running, in order for those changes to be recognized VS Code needs to be closed and re-open.
For instance, when running npm i -g <something> or choco install <package> in another prompt or powershell window, those new commands are not recognized until the app is rebooted.
It would be great if adding a new terminal instance with + would load these new variables/apps/notsurewhatterminologytouse.

LightTable and Swift allow for inline evaluation which also places the results in line with the particular line of source which was evaluated.
A new widget would be necessary for this. This widget would be able to hold values or arrays or plots with arrays and plots requiring expansion to be shown fully as to not clutter the editor. The widget would not be dismissed upon losing focus and multiple widgets are possible in the editor.
https://github.com/JunoLab/atom-ink and https://github.com/nteract/hydrogen are two examples of this done in atom.
Below are two example images from Juno which is based on LightTable.

title: ['Decorations with gutter icons hide breakpoint icons ¡¤ Issue #5923 ¡¤ microsoft/vscode ¡¤ GitHub']
VSCode Version: 1.0.0
OS Version: any

Steps to Reproduce:

Create a decoration type window.createTextEditorDecorationType({ gutterIconPath: ... }); with an icon, decorate a line.
Set a breakpoint for the line. While the breakpoint works, the decoration type gutter icon is completely hiding it.

Ideally, there should be a way to see both (all) icons. I'm assuming the same issue happens if two different extensions set different icons for the same line. Atom and IntelliJ platform based IDEs solve this by allowing to create a plugin specific gutter/or just extending the gutter horizontally to fit all icons.
If the above mentioned solution is not desirable for some reason, then it should probably be allowed to set a gutter icon zIndex for a decoration type. Or maybe the breakpoint icon should just take precedence and always be displayed above any extensions icons.

Issue Type: Bug
Sounds exactly like #45303 but that was closed without a resolution other than "windows update made it go away". I use vscode on three different machines running ubuntu 18.04 and I only observe this on one of them. This started happening several updates ago, I wish I had captured the version when it first started. Mostly I've just been living with it for quite a while.
When I try to move a tab from one pane to another, the tab rendering follows my mouse but the tab doesn't move:

title: ['Allow extensions to be installed for all users ¡¤ Issue #56614 ¡¤ microsoft/vscode ¡¤ GitHub']
I'm the instructor a college Python programming course. I'd love to adopt VS Code for this course, but the fact that extensions are installed on a per-user basis is a major problem. For education and enterprise markets, there needs to be support for pre-installing extensions for all users.
It's important that we be able to provide a ready-to-use environment to students on login. I have 50 students in my class. I can't afford to lose class time to making students install the Python extension each time they use a new computer or to help troubleshooting students when they have problems.
I've put together a very hackish workaround where I've created a batch file that installs the plugin and then launches VS Code. I've added shortcuts to this batch file, but it's messy and I fear brittle.
Please add a flag to code --install-extension that allows users to specify the extension is to be installed for all users.
FWIW, @rhyspaterson mentioned needing this same functionality in a comment on Issue #27972.

title: ['Native node modules from extensions ¡¤ Issue #658 ¡¤ microsoft/vscode ¡¤ GitHub']
I¡¯m looking to build an extension but one of the packages I need to depend on is a native module. When I do an npm install it installs the package just fine, I can launch a node shell and interact with it, etc. But when I go to use the package from within my plugin I get an error as it¡¯s trying to load the ia32 build of the native module not the x64 which was compiled by node-gyp.
A quick bit of debugging indicates that the problem stems by process.arch returning ia32 when running in VS Code when my machine is a x64 machine (Win10 x64).
So is there some way to either:

Have VS Code run an x64 process
Have VS Code¡¯s ia32 process do my npm restore (and subsequent compile with node-gyp)

Otherwise I fear that my extension might be dead in the water ??

Steps to Reproduce:
We use some command line tools from ARM to organise our project. This tools rely on special lib files to establish dependencies between modules. Each module should be an independent repository (git repositories in our case). So once all the references are deployed (the tools will "git clone" the indicated repositories in the lib files) the folder structure would look like this (folders in bold):


project_folder (git repo)

module1.lib
module2.lib
module1 (git repo)

module3.lib
module3 (git repo)


module2 (git repo)




If we add project_folder as the root folder, the source control tab will only track the changes done in project_folder.
If we use the new multi-root project feature and also add module1, module2, and module3 to the workspace; we still find that only the changes in project_folder are tracked.
Nevertheless, if we add the folder in an strict reverse nesting order in the following manner:

With an empty project open module3 as root folder
Add folder to workspace... module2
Add folder to workspace... module1
Add folder to workspace... project_folder

Then we see that the source control view displays the several source control providers correctly.

Reproduces without extensions: Yes

title: ['Explore Extensions Management UX ¡¤ Issue #68527 ¡¤ microsoft/vscode ¡¤ GitHub']
Explore Extensions Management UX
Extensions Management include:


Managing installed extensions

Enabled
Disabled
All installed
Built in
Outdated



Browsing Marketplace

Searching
Categories
Order of viewing



Show Recommendations

Workspace
General (file)



Over the time this viewlet has become a single place for all of the above which made it

Flooded with views and making them hard to manage
Hard to distinguish among installed, recommendations and market place
Missing prominent information on installed extensions

Active
Running
Activation time


Viewlet is lacking space to provide necessary information like

Why reload is required
Due to this fact, we have a different page for running extensions


There is no nice landing page
Hard to browse extensions in market place with categories

This seems like Extensions viewlet is overloaded with too many features and used for managing/browsing/customising extensions instead of just using like an explorer.
Goal of this issue is to explore some ideas considering all above use cases and come with a good design which gets aligned with current VS Code UX.
Following are some issues that are kinda related to current viewlet

Set worskpace encoding to cp437.
Do a worskspace search for anything.
The search box is surrounded in red, a popup appears underneath it saying "Unknown encoding: cp437".

That's a regression.

Just as Mozilla did in Firefox 59 (you can check it out in Firefox Nightly atm), and someone was doing for the Mac version in #12377, it would be really good to have an option to integrate the title bar in the same row where the tabs reside, in order to save some vertical space (which is even more important if like me you usually work on a non-FHD laptop such as an old Thinkpad or a Dell Latitude).
I said in Gnome cause it's what I use, but maybe it could be made into a more portable solution that has options for all DEs with top bars (be it Mac, Gnome, Xfce...). Like Mozilla did, it could even start to roll out when just some DEs are supported, with the warning that it may not work on all systems.
